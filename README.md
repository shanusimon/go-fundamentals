# 🚀 Go Fundamentals — From JavaScript to Go

This repo documents my journey learning **Go (Golang)** — coming from a **JavaScript / Node.js** background.  
It’s a collection of small experiments, examples, and notes as I explore Go’s syntax, tooling, and idioms.

## 🧠 Why Go?

As a JavaScript developer, I was drawn to Go for:
- ⚡️ **Performance:** Compiled, statically typed, and incredibly fast.
- 🧩 **Simplicity:** Clean, minimal syntax compared to TypeScript or complex JS frameworks.
- 🧵 **Concurrency:** Goroutines & channels make multithreading elegant.
- 🚀 **Deployment:** Single binary builds — no `node_modules` hell.
- 🛠 **Strong standard library:** HTTP servers, file I/O, JSON, testing — all built-in.
